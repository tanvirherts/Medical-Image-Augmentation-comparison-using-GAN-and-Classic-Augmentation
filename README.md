# GAN-based Synthetic Augmentation for COVID-19 CT Scan Classification

## 📌 Project Overview
This project replicates the methodology of using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to augment medical imaging datasets. It demonstrates that adding synthetic data generated by a DCGAN improves the performance of a VGG16 classifier in detecting COVID-19 from Chest CT scans.

## 🏗 Architecture
1.  **DCGAN:** Trained separately on COVID and Non-COVID classes to generate synthetic samples.
2.  **VGG16 Classifier:** Modified for single-channel grayscale input and binary classification.
3.  **Pipeline:**
    * **Phase A:** Train baseline on real data.
    * **Phase B:** Train GANs and generate 2,000 synthetic images.
    * **Phase C:** Train augmented model (Real + Synthetic).

## 📊 Results
* **Classic Augmentation Accuracy:** 93.28%
* **GAN Augmentation Accuracy:** 97.58%

## 🔧 Requirements
* Python 3.8+
* PyTorch (MPS enabled for Mac / CUDA for NVIDIA)
* See `requirements.txt` for dependencies.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Download the SARS-CoV-2 CT-Scan Dataset from Kaggle.
2.  Update the `DATASET_PATH` in the notebook to point to your data.
3.  Run the cells in `main.ipynb`.
